# Python Data Structures
*Written by: Caleb Hall - chall16@byui.edu - CSE 212-02*

This is a tutorial demonstrating the usage of 3 different data structures in python, queues, sets, and trees. It is written for those who already have a solid understanding of python. This is probably a good fit for you if you understand classes and recursion.

Chapters:
1. [Queues](1-Queues.md)
1. [Sets](2-Sets.md)
1. [Trees](3-Trees.md)

Each chapter contains information about the data structure, example code, and a problem for you to solve. There are links to the solution for each problem. Avoid looking at the problem until you have it working yourself or you are stuck.
